## Overview:

Bucket Boys is a relatively simple turn based platformer where you have a set amount of switches between two player characters to reach the flags at end of the level.

To accomplish this goal you will have to use the buckets to help you navigate the level as they offer protection from enemies and platforms to jump in order to complete the levels

If you run out of switches you will fail and restart the level. This game was made for the Weekly Game Jam 193 and our small team consists of 5 students.

Hope you enjoy the game and leaving feedback would be appreciated. Look below for more details 

Note: There MIGHT be like a bug...or 2.... 

Note2: All levels CAN be beaten.

( If you just wanted to go through the game or find any level too hard you can use PageUp and PageDown to navigate the different levels.)
